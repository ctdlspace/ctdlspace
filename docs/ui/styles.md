### Class Names


## BEM
- We use BEM
- Naming format blockName_elementName__firstMofifierName__secondModifiername
- According to [General Convention](docs/conventions.js) we use camelCase notation for class names
- According to [General Convention](docs/conventions.js) we always use _ (underscore) as a separator and do not use - (minus sign)
- We use _ (single underscore) to split block and element
- We use __ (double underescore) to split modifiers
- We only use boolean modifiers and never user modifier_value
