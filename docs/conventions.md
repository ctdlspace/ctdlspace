# CTDL Space Conventions

This document describes how to create things in a predictable and consistent manner.

## Naming 

We try no keep things consistent and unified across all languages an tools. Our general naming convention is:
- Use camelCase for everything or PascalCase for React components as an exception;
- Use underscore as a delimeter, never use - or anything else as a delimenter. Becouse only _ acts same acrose all the tools, Databse, HTML, CSS/Less, JavaScript;
- Use _ to define hierarchy not for visual sugar.
